Prompting is great, but sometimes you need a more programmatic approach. Thatâ€™s where function calling comes in. In this course, senior staff instructor, web designer, and software developer Morten Rand-Hendriksen explains function calling with the OpenAI API.

## Instructions

This repository has no branches. Each example featured in the course is contained in a separate file, prefixed 01, 02, and 03. To follow along, open the relevant file and follow the instructions in the course.

## Installing

To run the queries in the example files, you need an OpenAI API key. 

1. Sign up for the OpenAI API at [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Generate a new key at [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Copy the key (you only get to see it once).
4. Open `/.vscode/settings.json` and paste your key where indicated (bottom of the file).
5. Open `01-standard-query.http`.
6. In the bottom toolbar, click on the words "No Environment" and change the setting to "openai". This will activate your key in the file and allow it to be used.
